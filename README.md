# Minor_Project 
## Title - Air Quality Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning 
### Introduction 
This is our minor project based on research of air quality and the elements that affect the quality of air. The i factors such as wind speed, humidity, precipitation , dew points etc have the huge impact on increasing or decreasing of PM2.5 which is considered as the main pollutant. To reduce the amount of PM2.5 , study of these factors helps a lot and can implement contolling measures. 
We used both statistical and machine learning method to study the reationship .
